# No NowPlaying

Converts any skin using SpotifyPlugin or NowPlaying to use WebNowPlaying

# Usage

Install the latest .rmskin from [releases](https://github.com/reisir/nonp/releases).

Load the skin (should load automatically on install).

Hold ctrl + alt and click on the skin you want to convert.

Click the image that appears to convert the skin.

If the image doesn't appear the skin does not use NowPlaying or SpotifyPlugin.

### Disclaimer

The conversion script operates very crudely. If a file contains a single section using NowPlaying or SpotifyPlugin, it will completely replace the file, adding a bunch of new lines to the end because the regex is a bit messed up.

So if you're developing a skin or have heavily modified a skin, do not use this. It has a non-zero chance to completely destroy the skin. 

If the script breaks a skin, run the skins .rmskin installer again to fix it, join the [Rainmeter Discord](https://discord.gg/rainmeter) and tag me ([@reisir](https://github.com/reisir)) in the [#help](https://discord.com/channels/148103787259756544/148718731743199233) channel. If you use another channel you will be banned and if you DM me you will be blocked :3
