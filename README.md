# No NowPlaying

Converts any skin using SpotifyPlugin or NowPlaying to use WebNowPlaying

### Disclaimer

The script operates very crudely. If a file contains a single section using NowPlaying or SpotifyPlugin, it will completely replace the file, adding a bunch of newlines to the end because the regex is a bit messed up.

So if you're developing a skin or have heavily modified a skin, do not use this. It has a non-zero chance to completely destroy the skin. 

If the script breaks a skin, run the skins .rmskin installer again to fix it, join the [Rainmeter Discord](https://discord.gg/rainmeter) and tag me ([@reisir](https://github.com/reisir)) in the [#help](https://discord.com/channels/148103787259756544/148718731743199233) channel. If use another channel you will be banned and if you DM me you will be blocked :3
